STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TESTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comparison Against: XGBoost v1.0 (Candidate)

Block Bootstrap Results:
  - Status: REJECTED (XGBoost worse)
  - Mean Difference (XGBoost - Ridge): +0.716 points (XGBoost WORSE, not better)
  - 95% CI: [0.4345, 0.9986] (positive = worse)
  - P(improvement): 0.0000% (ZERO probability of improvement)

Diebold-Mariano Results:
  - Status: FAVORED (Ridge preferred)
  - DM Statistic: 6.47
  - P-Value: 1.01e-08
  - Significance (p < 0.05): YES (extremely significant)
  - Direction: Ridge is SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER than XGBoost

FINAL DECISION: NO-GO
  - Meaning: Do NOT deploy XGBoost
  - Reason: No statistically significant improvement

DEPLOYMENT STATUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Production Champion: Ridge Regression v1.0
  - Is Deployed: YES
  - Reasoning: Significantly outperforms XGBoost under walkforward CV

Candidate: XGBoost v1.0
  - Is Deployed: NO
  - Reasoning: Worse out-of-sample performance under production protocol
